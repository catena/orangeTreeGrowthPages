## Overview

- Demonstrates how a simple nonlinear least squares prediction model can be fitted
in R.
- The application tries to estimate the size of an orange tree given the age.
- Input is the age measured in days and output is the trunk circumference (mm).
- Features an interactive graph panel that displays the training data as well as the fitted model.

## Dataset

- The Orange dataset in R `nlme` package is used to train the predictor
- The trunk circumference of 5 trees is measured at 7 different  ages
- Data frame consists 35 rows of records of the growth containing 3 columns:
    * Tree: an ordered factor indicating the tree on which the measurement is made.
    * age: a numeric vector giving the age of the tree in days
    * circumference: a numeric vector of "trunk circumferences at breast height" (mm) commonly used by foresters.


```{r dataSummary}
head(Orange)

## Prediction Model

- Non linear logistic regression model.
- The R `nls` function is used to determine the nonlinear (weighted) least-squares estimates of the parameters of the model.
- Unlike in the linear case, the parameters must be declared explicitly in a nonlinear model formula. `SSlogis` function is used to determine the self starting estimates.

```{r modelFit}
fit <- nls(circumference ~ SSlogis(age, Asym, xmid, scale), data = Orange)
fit
```

## Prediction Model (contd)

```{r simpleplot,fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
g <- qplot(age, circumference, data = Orange, geom = c("point", "line"), 
           color = Tree, xlab = "Age (days)", ylab = "Circumference (mm)",
           main = "Growth of Orange Trees")
age <- seq(0, 1600, length.out = 101)
g <- g + geom_line(aes(x = age, y = predict(fit, list(age = age))), 
                   size = 2, color = "#7777FF")
g
```
